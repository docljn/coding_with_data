##Introduction
Throughout the rest of the course we are going to be analysing information about the countries of the world. Today we are going practice accessing information about a country, which will be in the form of hashes and arrays.


[i:] Hand out start point

##Start point
The start point contains the information for a country.  This is a hash, some of the values of the hash are other hashes or arrays.

The task is to print out the requested information about the country.

We'll go through the first answer together.

touch country.rb
```
#Name
puts "The name of the country is.."
puts country["name"]
puts "\n"
```
