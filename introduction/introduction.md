##Computers in the work place
Many tasks are being done by computers in the work place that were previously done by humans. This is changing the dynamic of the work place, and the roles of humans in it.

##Why use computers
Many tasks can be processed by a computer much quicker and more precisely than humans.

We process at a whole different magnitude than computers.

[ We tend to perform task at about one a second - computers at around 2,000,000,000 a second. ]

[ An other way, if a computer was doing things at our pace(1 task per second) from it's perspective we would take 63 years to perform a single task! ]

There is clearly a saving of time if we can automate task to a computer.  There is also increased accuracy - computers don't suffer from human error.  Any problem with a computer program, will be down to the human who programmed it - not the computer.

If a task can be automated and performed by a computer - it should.

##Connected world
Information is becoming more accessible.  The internet allows fast accessible information from anyway in the world. Governments and companies are making their information accessible.  On wednesday we'll learn how we can plug into data sources over the internet and analyse the information.

##AI
Computers also entering into what we considered human. Intelligence. Chess, Knowledge. 

##Humans redundant?

Not yet anyway.

##Examples:
Accounting:

Pre computing: Bookkeeping - manually entering the books.

Computing early: Sage, Quickbooks: Desktop computers in the office running purchased accounting softwre - in-house accountant entering the information.

Now: Internet(cloud) based accounting systems.  Payment systems connect directly to the accounting software. No manual entry needed.  Accounting analysing information via third party systems. (Xero, Freeagent).

Accounts analyse information using 3rd party packages producing reports.

##Programming
Computers need to be instructed what to do. They follow instructions at an incredible speed to fine detail blindly.  They can be made to appear to be smart, by giving them smart instructions.  The skill is in giving them the instructions; programming.

#Why are WE learning to code?
[DLA]
1. better understanding of clients
2. Common ground.  If x then y
3. Learning to code ...

##Course
In this course we will learn about how we can instruct computers to automate tasks.  We will see how we can get data in split seconds from all over the world (web api's), how we can write computer programs to analyse the data, and how we can display the information via web technologies on laptops and mobile phones.

#day1 - Introduction
Introduction to programming languages and how we can represent information using them.

#day2 - Analysing/aggregating data
See how we can analyse the data and automate tasks that would take humans.

#day3 - Connecting/Surfacing application via the web
Get information from external sources via web apis.(Connect world)
Display the information via the web.
